## Professional Statement
My name is Anantha Krishnan. I am an ambitious person with a strong drive to build a career in cybersecurity. I thrive on solving complex problems, mastering new technologies, curious in solving the puzzles of cyberspace and bringing order to challenging situations – skills I have honed as a machine operator and now apply to digital defense.

In August 2024, I passed the **Google IT Support** exam on my first attempt and am actively progressing through the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. I study consistently every week, DNS in Detail, and document all projects on GitHub.

I am passionate about protecting organisations through proactive threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. My immediate goal is to secure an **entry-level SOC Analyst or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst role** within the next 3-6 months. This certificate will provide the practical networking, Linux, SIEM, and response skills employers demand, enabling me to deliver real value from Day 1 and grow into a trusted cybersecurity professional.
